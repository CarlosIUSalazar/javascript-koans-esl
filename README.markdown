# javascript-koans-esl
This is mrdavidlaing's JavaScript Koans but with simple English. The Buddhist, vague language has been mostly replaced with simple English and set-up instructions are added for complete beginners.

Javascript koans is to teach you JavaScript programming through testing. When you first run the koans, you will be given a 'runtime error' and a 'stack trace' indicating where the error occured.

Your goal is to find and fix the error.

Through exploring the code and fixing the errors, you will learn new things about the JavaScript language and functional programming.

#### What are koans?
> A koan is a riddle or puzzle that Zen Buddhists use during meditation to help them unravel greater truths about the world and about themselves.

### Open in Text Editor
If you do not have a text editor for JavaScript, I highly recommend downloading and installing [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Open this `javascript-koans-esl project` folder in your text editor.

## How to Start

1. Open the `KoansRunner.html` file in the browser (for example, Chrome or Firefox).
2. The first error will be in `koans/AboutExpects.js`.

3. Fix the first test in the `koans/AboutExpects.js` file and save it.

4. Refresh the `KoansRunner.html` page you have open in the browser.

5. Repeat! Fix a test, save the file, refresh the browser. Tests will turn green when they are correct.

## Tips

Do not think too much about each problem--they are simple, especially in the beginning.

## Other Information

Is there anything that needs to be explained in simpler English? Let me know.

The test runner used is [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) with a customized report viewer. Understanding Jasmine is not important for finishing this.
